abstract = {Mono-CCD color cameras acquire only one color component at each pixel by means of their color filter array (CFA) covering the CCD sensor. To obtain a color image, a procedure - called demosaicing - is then necessary to estimate the other two missing color components at each pixel. This chapter deals with the quality of color images generated in such a way. We attempt to determine which demosaicing method provides the best results according to several comparison criteria, particularly for subsequent needs of color image analyses like edge detection.},

abstract = {<p>This paper introduces a new interpolation technique for demosaicing of color
images produced by single-CCD digital cameras. We show that the proposed simple
linear filter can lead to an improvement in PSNR of over 5.5 dB when compared to
bilinear demosaicing, and about 0.7 dB improvement in R and B interpolation when
compared to a recently introduced linear interpolator. The proposed filter also
outperforms most nonlinear demosaicing algorithms, without the artifacts due to
nonlinear processing, and a much reduced computational complexity.</p>},

abstract = {Most digital cameras use a color filter array to capture the colors of the scene. Downsampled versions of the red, green, and blue components are acquired, and an interpolation of the three colors is necessary to reconstruct a full representation of the image. This color interpolation is known as demosaicing. The most effective demosaicing techniques proposed in the literature are based on directional filtering and a posteriori decision. In this paper, we present a novel approach to this reconstruction method. A refining step is included to further improve the resulting reconstructed image. The proposed approach requires a limited computational cost and gives good performance even when compared to more demanding techniques.},
